An open source platform designed for college societies to upload and manage events, and for students to view all upcoming events at one place.

Three society heads can register their society on the site, each of them can upload, edit and delete upcoming events of their society. On the main page, all upcoming events of all societies will be displayed, and on the profile page of the society, all events will displayed.

This is a REST API for the [SSR version](https://github.com/light7714/societyBoardSSR), with no frontend.
